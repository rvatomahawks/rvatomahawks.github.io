	<center><h2>Mission Statement</h2></center>
	<p>Our mission at the RVA Tomahawks (Located: Richmond, Virginia) is to create
cultivate second chance opportunity for you men who did or did not a sufficient GPA
coming out of high school to move forward with pursuing a college education and
potentially playing college football. Further, we are also seeking athletes who’s
dreams may have faded of ever playing this great game and may have possibly never
finished completing their high school education as well. We believe that everyone
deserves a chance and we are excited to be in the posture to present individual
athletes with the opportunity to bring about a greater quality of life for the
individual while also helping them realize that “the sky is the limit” and that the
possibilities within their reach are very real and tangible if they are willing to make
a determined commitment while working hard to apply themselves properly.</p>
	<center><h2>The nature of the program</h2></center>
	<p>The nature of the program revolves around our tireless commitment to excellence
in teaching the latest innovative skills and techniques to our athletes to empower
them to play the game of football at the highest level achievable. We believe that we

	<center><h2>Philosophy</h2></center>
	<p>Our philosophy at the RVA Tomahawks is that by fostering a culture base on ethical
and moral values, we have the awesome privilege of not only raising up some fine
football players but, we have the blessed opportunity to impact the world, one
individual at a time by shaping our young men through the game of football and by
mentoring them to bring about characteristics like honor, respect, accountability
and integrity, faith coupled with belief to help them understand that anything is
possible, and finally, leadership qualities so that they can lead a fulfilled life by
reaching out and helping others, Further, we believe that these qualities empower
our athletes to become effective models which is something that the world’s culture
desperately needs at this very moment and time.</p>
